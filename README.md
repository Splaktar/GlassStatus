GlassStatus
===========

Voice-activated Google Glass status screen (Battery level, Network, Uptime)

This fork has been converted to Android Studio. If you would like to use Eclipse, see the parent repository.

This simple little app is based on [Alex Dennis's] work on the [Glass Battery Level app].

By installing this app, you can use the voice command "OK Glass, Status" to display the current Battery level, Network, and Uptime for Glass.
